Spawn, then:
<!-- - If marked as 'passive' do nothing (never explode, never wander) -->
- If has (preassigned) path, follow path, else pick random path near self
- If near player (say, x10 player radius), follow shortest path to random point around player
- If in triggerbox of player (say, x1.5 player radius), fucken explode
