# Gameplay
- The player is a sharp object that can move around the map by 'slingshotting' themselves
- The player can cut through the bubbles that are on the map
- Walls are not penetrable

# Levels
- We have multiple levels that are hand-made

# AI
- There are two types of Bubbles on the map, manually placed ones that are present at level start and generated ones that are spawned by a bubble spawner. The generated bubbles leave the vicinity of the spawner and go on one of the predefined patrol routes. For all bubble types, if they are close to the player (within a certain radius), they will start seeking the player.

# Tutorial
- Just text on screen
